# Computer Networks
In the third year of study in computer science. This is my personal assignment for computer network, which involves many technical points of network transmission.

**Task 1-ping**

Requirements:
1.The domain name or IP of the given URL
2.Simulate command line output with code (must be output line by line, in English, in the python console)
3.The code for checksums has been provided, and no mastery of writing code is required. But you need to understand.
4.Time needs to be calculated by code
5.Familiar with ICMP

**Task 2-Traceroute**

1.The domain name or IP of the given URL
2.Simulate command line output with code (Must be output line by line, in English, python console)
3. Special processing of specific packets, such as *

**Task 3-Web Server**
1.Build a simple server with python code,
2.After startup, wait for listening
3.Use software (Wget, Postman, various browsers, etc.) to send web requests (get, post, update...)
4.The request message was read and parsed.
5.Return the corresponding message according to the specific situation (normal, error, redirection, etc.) (such as 404, 200, etc.)
6.Requirements: How to use the software to view request and response
7.Extension: You can write complex interfaces yourself (no necessary requirements)

**Task 4-Web Proxy**
1.On the basis of task three, write the proxy server.
2.Require representation of "agency." QA needs to specify which commands, or Settings, are used to send requests to the proxy server instead of the server specified in the url.
3.For the file to be returned, the file does not exist on the proxy server when QA begins, and needs to be downloaded from the remote server to the proxy server and then returned to the client.
4.The second time the same request is sent, the file is returned directly from the proxy server to the client.



The coursework of Network Application Development is split into a number of smaller tasks: **Task 1.1** ICMP Ping Client, **Task 1.2** Traceroute Client, **Task 2.1** Web Server and **Task 2.2** Web Proxy. Importantly, the tasks build upon each other; the work you do in Task 1.1 will be fundamental to Task 1.2, and similarly, the work completed in Task 2.1 will greatly assist you in Task 2.2.
